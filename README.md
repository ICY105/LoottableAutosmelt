# Loottable Autosmelt
A Minecraft Datapack that uses loot tables to add the ability for tools to auto smelt mined blocks. Also includes the ability to void common block drops like cobblestone.

## Enchantments
As of version 2.0, Loottable Autosmelt adds 2 custom enchantments: `loottable_autosmelt:autosmelt` and `loottable_autosmelt:trash`. Simply add these to any item you wish to have these features. NBT data is no longer supported.

By default, these enchantments are not accessible via survival in any way.

## How to use
1. Copy the contents the `data/minecraft` folder into your data pack.
2. Manually merge any conflicting loot tables you may have
3. Implement the API as described above.
